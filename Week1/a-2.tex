Hello world! This is my first \LaTeX\, document. My name is [yourname] and
my student id is [yourstudentid].


This is a new paragraph. Notice that \LaTeX\, automatically indent a new
paragraph.\\


\noindent This paragraph is not indented and has one-line space from above. How did I
do it?\\


In March 2006, Congress raised that ceiling an additional \$0.79 trillion to
\$8.97 trillion, which is approximately 68\% of GDP. As of October 4, 2008, the
\enquote{Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008} raised the current debt ceiling
to \$11.3 trillion.


My favorite characters are \# \& \$.


\begin{flushright} 
You'll notice that \ul{this paragraph} is \textit{not} justified in the usual manner.\footnote{The default justification for \LaTeX\, is full justification} 
I just wanted something different.
\end{flushright}

\begin{center}
Note the justification of \textbf{this paragraph} too. This time I just want to be in
\texttt{the middle.}
\end{center}

The following word is 
\begin{huge}Huge\end{huge} 
but the following word is 
\begin{scriptsize}scriptsize.\end{scriptsize}\\
What comes next is

\vspace{2cm}

\noindent 2cm below.\\
\indent Use the hfill command to push \hfill this to the right
\indent\fbox{\parbox{5cm}{This paragraph has 5cm width and is put inside a box.}}
