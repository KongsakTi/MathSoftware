I received the book \cite{dm} for Christmas in 2009, but I haven't read it yet.

You may have heard of the famous book about John Nash, called \textit{A Beautiful Mind}.  It was made
into a movie. Despite all of his problems, Nash never underwent electroshock therapy; his wife refused to
let the doctors treat him that way.  (See \cite[page 306]{sn}.)
